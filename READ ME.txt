Implementation 

This project follows an MVC architecture, handling different user roles such as: Admin, Manager, and Cashier. The app has a clear separation between models, views, and controllers. It is based on JavaFX libraries for its user interface, providing a graphical and interactive experience for users. However there are some minor inconveniences that the unit testing (using Junit) has brought up.
